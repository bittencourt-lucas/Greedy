/**
* Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm implemented by Lucas Bittencourt.
*
* Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree is a Greedy algorithm. This implementation uses
* the adjacency matrix of the graph to calculate the minimum spanning tree.
* This implies that the complexity of the code is O(VÂ²), but it's easier to
* understand the concepts.
